# OpenZeppelin Vanilla Template for Substrate

Substrate has a steep learning curve. In order to make it easier for newcomers to get started, OpenZeppelin provides 2 templates that can be used to quickly bootstrap a Substrate project:
- vanilla template (has the minimal pallet set)
- feature-rich template (has all the pallets that are commonly used in Substrate projects)
-

Along with these two templates, OpenZeppelin also provides a documentation website that explains how to add or deduct all the common pallets to your Substrate project (and these templates).

So, you can select the template that fits your needs and start building your Substrate project. On the road, if you feel like you need to make some changes, our documentation on how to add or deduct pallets will be helpful.
